# Fashion MNIST Classification

In this project, I build an neural network to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
